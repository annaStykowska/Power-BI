##### Bollinger band
Bollinger band gives traders an idea of where the market is moving based on prices.
It involves the use of three bands â€” one for the upper level, one for the lower level, and the third for the moving average (20 days). 
They are often used to determine overbought and oversold conditions.
##### Bollinger band buy/sell signal counter
A buy signal is generated when the price line falls below the lower level of the band.
A sell signal is generated when the price breaks the upper level of the band.
